Subject: Virtue Theory and Abortion, Rosalind Hursthouse


In the first part of her paper, Virute Theory and Abortion, Hursthouse introduces virtue theory in general and nine main criticisms of it. Hursthouse addresses these criticisms and then applies virtue theory in practice to the problem of abortion.

Criticism 1

Virtue Theory is obscure and difficult to understand

The first criticism Hursthouse addresses is that virtue theory is often considered obscure and difficult to understand. Critics of virtue theory argue that the concept of eudaimonia, or human flourishing, which is central to the theory, is unclear and hard to grasp. According to Hursthouse, “the popular view is that it [virtue theory] has a problem with this [obscurity] which deontology and utilitarianism in no way share.”

Hursthouse rejects the criticism that virtue theory is inherently obscure. She acknowledges that the concept of eudaimonia may not be easy to comprehend, but she argues that this does not make virtue theory any more obscure than other ethical theories. She points out that concepts such as rationality and happiness, which are central to deontological and utilitarian theories respectively, are also complex and subject to debate. Hursthouse suggests that virtue theory is not dismissed on the grounds of the comparative obscurity of the concept of eudaimonia, and therefore, it should not be singled out as a weakness of virtue ethics.

As Hursthouse disclaims in the introduction, she rejects this criticism but does “not claim that it is necessarily misplaced.” What she means by this is that the criticism is valid for virtue ethics, but is just as valid for deontology and utilitarianism. If deontology and utilitarianism are safe from this criticism so should virtue theory. “Both rationality and happiness, as they figure in their respective theories,” deontology and utilitarianism respectively, “are rich and difficult concepts”. Eudaimonia is a rich and difficult concept as well.



Criticism 2

Virtue ethics does not provide clear rules or principles for action

Another criticism of virtue theory Hursthouse addresses is that it fails to provide clear and specific action-guiding rules or principles. Critics argue that virtue ethics relies on abstract concepts like virtues and vices, but lacks clear guidance on what one should do in specific moral dilemmas. Hursthouse gives an example of the criticism – critics argue that deciding within the framework of virtue theory is “taking one’s favored candidate for a virtuous person and asking oneself, ‘What would they do in these circumstances?’”. Hursthouse demonstrates this criticism with the paper’s practical subject – abortion. Should the fifteen-year-old raped girl ask herself what Socrates would have done in her situation? It is unclear that Socrates would have such a course of action for so different a circumstance.

Furthermore, critics claim that virtue theory is circular insofar as it specifies right actions in terms of the virtuous agent and the virtuous agent in terms of right action.

Hursthouse rejects the criticism that virtue ethics does not provide clear rules or principles. She explains that virtues such as justice, honesty, and courage do generate positive instructions for action and vices generate prohibitions. Hursthouse argues that virtue ethics does provide specific guidance for action through these instructions and prohibitions. She clarifies that one does not need to rely solely on the hypothetical actions of an ideal virtuous person, as critics suggest, but can apply the concepts of virtues and vices directly to evaluate one's own actions. Rather than asking, "What would a virtuous person do?", one can ask, "Is my action just or unjust? Is it honest or dishonest?" These questions allow individuals to make decisions based on their understanding of virtues and vices.

In her response, Hursthouse highlights that virtue theory does not seek to define the virtuous agent solely as someone who follows deontological moral rules. Instead, it aims to provide a substantial understanding of the virtuous agent through the virtues they possess. She asserts that virtue theory goes beyond dispositions to right action and encompasses character traits that contribute to human flourishing i.e. eudaimonia.

Hursthouse asserts that virtue theory can indeed answer the question of what one should do in particular situations by considering whether the action aligns with the virtues or vices associated with it. While acknowledging that there may be cases where the virtues seem to conflict, she points out that rule-based deontology also faces similar challenges. She argues that moral wisdom is required to navigate these dilemmas and make the appropriate choices, just as mathematical knowledge cannot be acquired solely through lectures but must be cultivated through experience and understanding.
